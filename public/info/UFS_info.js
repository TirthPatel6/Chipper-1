<div class="infoTitle">ABOUT UFS</div>
<div class="infoText">UFS (Universal Flash Storage) has emerged as the preferred flash memory standard for high-end phones in recent years. eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard) is still the most prominent memory standard around — with the Pixel 3a series using an eMMC 5.1 storage module — but UFS offers significantly higher bandwidth while consuming the same amount of power.<br><br>
UFS was primarily designed to deliver SSD-like speeds on mobile devices. The first-gen UFS modules offered three times faster file copying times, as well as vast improvements in multitasking over eMMC modules. UFS can do this as it is a full-duplex standard, meaning it can read and write data simultaneously. By contrast, eMMC can only read or write data at any given time.
