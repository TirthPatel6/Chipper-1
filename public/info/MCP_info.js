<div class="infoTitle">ABOUT MULTICHIP PACKAGES (MCP)</div>
<div class="infoText">A chip package that contains two or more chips. It is essentially a multichip module (MCM) that uses a laminated, printed-circuit-board-like substrate (MCM-L) rather than ceramic (MCM-C). MCPs are also tested after packaging, whereas the bare chips of ceramic-based MCMs were tested before packaging so as not to waste the more costly ceramic substrate if the chips were no good.
